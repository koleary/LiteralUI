# LiteralUI

The world of interaction design is evolving, but recently, with the advent of lightweight web and mobile SaaS applications as well as the proliferation of new devices and inputs, we see the growing convergence of several similar ideas in user interface design that we are grouping under the umbrella of Literal UI. Literal UI brings together concepts from Natural UI, Tangible UI, Physical UI, and Tactile UI, the common thread being that they all favor direct manipulation over metaphor and look towards a broader range of human inputs.

At its core Literal UI approaches favor direct manipulation over form-based configuration or indirect manipulation through symbols or facsimiles. At the simplest level it’s the difference between touching a thumbnail to enlarge it and clicking a button that says “enlarge”; at its most complex it’s moving your hands in space to literally “sculpt” digital clay with a VR device.

To get a sense of the change, take a complex application like Adobe Photoshop with all of its tabbed palettes and tiny configuration fields all over the screen, and then look at something like the “Paper” from 53 studios (iOS), where virtually all interaction is touch. The difference is striking, and we think it will soon be the norm for all applications.

With many designers moving in this direction, with mixed results and no base of common assumptions, we feel it’s time to more clearly define a Literal UI standard and begin to work out some fundamental principles and best practices. That’s the goal of this collaborative project: to gather the collective insights of design and UX experts who are currently producing in Literal UI design and synthesize those as a starting point for others.
