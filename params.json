{"name":"Literal UI","tagline":"Principles for frictionless, natural interfaces","body":"###Why literal UI? \r\n\r\nThe world of interaction design is evolving but recently, mainly with the advent of lightweight web and mobile SaaS applications we see the growing convergence of several similar ideas in user interface design that I am grouping under the umbrella of Literal UI. \r\nLiteral UI is an approach to design that favors direct manipulation as opposed to form-based configuration or indirect manipulation through symbols or facsimiles. At it’s simplest it’s the difference between touching a thumbnail to enlarge it and clicking button that says “enlarge”, at it’s most complex it’s moving your hands in space to literally “sculpt” digital clay with a VR device. Literal UI is not a new idea it encompasses approaches many designers and HCI experts have been talking about it for years like Natural UI, Tangible UI, Physical UI, Tactile UI, the common thread being that they all favor direct manipulation over metaphor and seek a broader range of human inputs.\r\n\r\nTo get a sense of the change take a complex application like Adobe photoshop with all of it’s tabbed palettes and tiny configuration fields all over the screen, then look at something like the “Paper” from 53 studios (iOS), where virtually all interaction is touch. The difference is striking and we think it will soon be the norm for all applications.\r\n\r\nWith many designers moving in this direction, with mixed results and no base of common assumptions, we feel it’s time to more clearly define a Literal UI standard and begin to work out some fundamental principles and best practices. That’s the goal of this collaborative document, to gather the collective insights of design and UX experts who are currently producing in Literal UI design and synthesize those as a starting point for others.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
